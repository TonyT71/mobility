Radiation model
================

With the implementation of the radiation model developed in
`Liu et Yan 2020 <https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-61613-y>`_,
you can reproduce spatially the mobility flows linked to a purpose
(such as home-work trips).

You can find an example of this model in <https://github.com/mobility-team/mobility/tree/main/examples/Millau>.
