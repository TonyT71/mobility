# Mobility, an open-source library for mobility modelisation
Mobility is an open-source solution to compute the carbon emissions due to the mobility of a local population.

It is developed mainly by [AREP](https://arep.fr) and [Elioth](https://elioth.com/) with [ADEME](https://wiki.resilience-territoire.ademe.fr/wiki/Mobility) support, but anyone can join us!
For now, it is mainly focused on French territories.
